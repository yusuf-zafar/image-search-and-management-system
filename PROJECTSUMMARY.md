## Project Summary:

The Image Search and Management System is a web application that allows users to search, upload, and manage images. The application has a frontend interface where users can perform searches based on titles, keywords, and date ranges. It also provides pagination and sorting options for search results. Users can click on images to view them in a popup.

The frontend is built using React, and the backend is developed using Node.js with Express. The frontend communicates with the backend through API requests to perform image searches and handle image uploads. User authentication and authorization have also been implemented to ensure only authorized users can access and manage the image collection.
