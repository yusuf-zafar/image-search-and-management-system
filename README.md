Welcome! This README provides instructions on how to run both the frontend and backend locally.

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
cd server

2. Install the required dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the backend server:
node server.js

The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.


## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
cd client

2. Install the required dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the frontend development server:
npm start

The frontend development server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.


## Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend are running locally, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- You may need to configure CORS settings on the backend to allow requests from the frontend development server.
